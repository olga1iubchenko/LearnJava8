CONCLUSION:
As far as we can see using the same input and absolutely equivalent data input we receive better performance results
for Java 8 compared to Java 7 run time for each test.
So I could say that Java 8 brought significant improvements to the simplicity of writing code,
filtering, sorting, and other common operations with Stream API and made performance improvements.
What makes the lives of developers a bit easier and happy )
